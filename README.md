# Graduation-Project

I use quantized-cnn demo which can be see here https://github.com/jiaxiang-wu/quantized-cnn to be embedded in my Android project.This project is developed by Android Stduio 2.3 under Ubuntu16.04.It mainly processes an image shot by phone's camera for image classification.And we assess its run time for comparison with its original model.You can refer to this project finding apk files to be installed on your own andorid phone for more details.
